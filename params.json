{"name":"ColdIgniter","tagline":"Clone, generate, deploy. No complex configurations.","body":"### Welcome to Simplifie ColdIgniter.\r\nHello PHP, Git and open-source experts out there using CodeIgniter. We're doing a free PHP framework.\r\nJust a hobby. Won't be big and professional --like PHP and Rails at Ruby On Rails.\r\nThis has been brewing since April and we're hoping for it to get ready this year.\r\nWe'd like any help, feedback on things people like or missing features on CodeIgniter, as our framework is based on top of it. Any suggestions are welcome --but we can't promise we'll actually implement them. -Excerpt from Linus.\r\n\r\n### Designer Files\r\nColdIgniter is currently designed to be integrated to Foundation Framework 5 for its view files. Bootstrap will be included soon.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nInclude extra features missing in CodeIgniter 2.1.0 to make developers more productive by speeding up workflow and meet project deadlines. The goal is to create another framework on top of CodeIgniter with extra features that original authors don't allow for valid reasons. It's still possible to maintain their concepts while adding more tools, so that developers don't need to look for libraries elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe focus will be on CLI without the need of configurations. Here's a generator example using either MS-DOS or Mac Terminal inside the ColdIgniter folder:\r\n\r\n    php index.php g crud student id:int full_name:varchar //Generates CRUD files.\r\n\r\nHere's a video that shows the early structure of the generator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW_o5flX3WU.\r\n\r\nOther great features include:\r\n* Advanced auth with privileges and permissions (not trying to become CMS here)\r\n* Multiple flavors of PayPal\r\n* Multiple upload support\r\n* Gallery\r\n* Adobe Flash support\r\n* Multi-threading\r\n* jQuery UI stuffs such as DateTimePicker\r\n* Analytics\r\n* Constrain ratio images\r\n* Font icons\r\n* Lots of helpers such as:\r\n  * getPostValuePair() - Retrieves all post values and excludes the ones listed in the array parameter\r\n  * showView() and showJsonView() - The first method is for layout purposes where you got a header and footer sections. All you need is to pass a partial view of the body\r\n  * validateLoginSession() - Validates controllers and redirects the user depending on the session and passed parameters\r\n  * isLoggedIn() and getLoggedUser()\r\n  * downloadAsCsv()\r\n  * and much more...\r\n\r\n### Why The Old CI Version?\r\nThere's a new CI 3 in town however, its requirements are still not thoroughly supported by most hosting providers. In addition, CI 3 is still an untested version. We need to wait a couple of months or at least a year to determine if developers would like it. As of the moment, CI 2+ is stable enough and widely acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe're still looking for authors and contributors.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to make requests personal?

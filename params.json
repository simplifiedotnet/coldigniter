{"name":"ColdIgniter","tagline":"Clone, generate, deploy. No complex configurations.","body":"### Welcome to Simplifie ColdIgniter.\r\nHello PHP, Git and open-source experts out there using CodeIgniter. We're doing a free PHP framework.\r\nJust a hobby. Won't be big and professional --like PHP and Rails at Ruby On Rails.\r\nThis has been brewing since April and we're hoping for it to get ready this year.\r\nWe'd like any help, feedback on things people like or missing features on CodeIgniter, as our framework is based on top of it. Any suggestions are welcome --but we can't promise we'll actually implement them. -Excerpt from Linus.\r\n\r\nThe project includes extra simple features that were missing in CodeIgniter 2.1.0 to make developers more productive by speeding up workflow and meet deadlines.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nColdIgniter is designed to be integrated to Foundation Framework 5 for its view files because they're cooler and not boring to look at in the long run. But okay, let's include Bootstrap soon as well.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nThe goal is to create a framework beyond CodeIgniter, but below CMS, that the original authors won't allow to be implemented for valid reasons. We believe it's still possible to maintain that concept while adding more tools so that developers don't need to look for libraries elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we need to focus on CLI --but one that doesn't need configurations. Here's a generator example using either MS-DOS or Mac Terminal inside the ColdIgniter folder:\r\n\r\n    php index.php g crud student id:int full_name:varchar user:ref //Generates CRUD files.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe're still looking for authors and contributors.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to make requests personal? Send us an email coldigniter@simplifie.net.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
